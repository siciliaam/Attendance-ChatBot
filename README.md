This project demonstrates a simple Telegram chatbot designed to record attendance data whenever a user sends a photo with specific descriptions such as 'Present', 'Permission', or 'Field'. The bot captures key information, including the username, attendance time, and date, ensuring an easy and efficient way to track attendance. The platform used for building the bot is Telegram, and the Bot Token can be obtained through the BotFather on Telegram to activate the bot. This chatbot serves as a practical tool for automating attendance tracking in various scenarios.

The Bot Token can be obtained from the BotFather on Telegram.
